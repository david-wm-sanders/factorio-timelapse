# factorio-timelapse

Timelapse is a mod for Factorio that takes screenshots of the world at the specified interval.

The screenshots are written to:
* `__PATH__system-write-data__/script-output/timelapse`
* `/home/user/.factorio/script-output/timelapse` on Linux
* `Users/Name/AppData/Roaming/Factorio/script-output/timelapse` on Windows

## Attention
The output of this mod can grow into GBs quite quickly! Keep an eye on the **script-output/timelapse** folder!
